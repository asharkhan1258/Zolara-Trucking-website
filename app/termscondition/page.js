            Customer agrees that ZOLARA LOGISTICS LLC shall have no liability whatsoever, including in contract, in tort (including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise, for cargo loss, damage, theft, destruction, or delay. At the Customer’s request, ZOLARA LOGISTICS LLC may facilitate processing of cargo claims with Carriers on Customer’s behalf; provided, however, that ZOLARA LOGISTICS LLC shall have no liability for such cargo claim notwithstanding its assistance. Carriers will agree to be liable for loss or damage to cargo pursuant to 49 USC § 14706 (the “Carmack Amendment”), but only with respect to cargo while moving within the United States or Canada, and then subject to the following limitations: (i) for a truckload shipment, $100,000 per trailer or conveyance; (ii) for a less-than-truckload or “LTL” shipment, the limit per pound for the applicable class set forth in the Carrier’s tariff, but in any case not to exceed $25.00 per pound of lost or damaged cargo up to $100,000 per trailer or conveyance; and (iii) for shipments containing household goods, $0.60 per pound of goods lost or damaged, up to a maximum of $100,000 per truckload; and (iv) for a shared truckload shipment, $100,000 in the aggregate per trailer or conveyance, provided that liability to each shipper will be prorated based on the linear feet of the trailer or container utilized by the shipper.

This Section will survive any termination of this Agreement.  In no event will any Carrier have any liability for cargo loss, damage, or destruction arising in Mexico, and if cargo has moved to, from or within Mexico, there will be a presumption that loss, damage or destruction occurred in Mexico unless overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that failure or alleged failure by the Carrier to comply with shipment handling instructions, or a broken, missing or unreadable trailer seal, shall not result in any presumption that food  has been adulterated, contaminated, or otherwise rendered unfit for its intended purpose, nor otherwise be grounds for rejection of a shipment or filing of a claim for cargo loss and damage without proof of actual loss or damage. Customer acknowledges and agrees that ZOLARA LOGISTICS LLC and Carriers will bear no liability for delay in delivery of cargo.
